# DJS09: Couch Surfing | Typescript Practice

## Challenge Oveview
The aim of the project was to create a web dashboard for displaying property reviews, user details and property listings.

The project employs CSS styling by importing a CSS file (index.css) to enhance the user interface aesthetics. JavaScript and TypeScript are used to write the main logic and functionality of the dashboard, ensuring a robust and interactive application. Dynamic content rendering is achieved through DOM manipulation, allowing real-time updates to the Document Object Model (DOM). Enums and interfaces are defined to maintain type safety and structured data, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the codebase. Object-oriented programming principles are applied by utilizing classes, such as creating instances for main properties. Additionally, event listeners are implemented to handle user interactions, such as adding reviews, thereby enhancing the responsiveness and interactivity of the dashboard.


##Challenges

The project was an intense code-along challenge, and it presented some difficulties, especially when coding a Scrimba project on VS Code. There were extra dependencies and configurations that needed to be installed, adding to the complexity. Additionally, I encountered a bug where the code meant to display the latest reviews is not functioning correctly. Despite my efforts, I have not been able to debug this issue. I plan to discuss this with my coach to explore potential solutions and fix the bug.
